* printing tips in java with some intellJ IDE specific shortcuts:
    - "sout" is the shortcut for "System.out.println();" statement.
    - you can use "Arrays.toString(yourArray);" to directly print arrays instead of writing a loop.
        - for multi-dimensional arrays, you can use the method: "deepToString(yourArray)" of the same "Arrays" class.
    - in order to print an array, put the name of the array followed by .sout then hit 'Enter'.

* When reading from input using ".nextInt()" method then decided to use another method ".nextLine()" you, most probably,
  have to be sure to flush the input stream using ".next();" or ".nextLine();"

* Sometimes you need to check against empty lines. "String line = scanner.nextLine(); while(line.trim().isEmpty()" is
  the solution to do that.

* If you want to make your life more easy wit arrays' loops, you can write the name of the array followed by a dot and
  'for'. a dropdown menu will be displayed. You may choose your loop of interest and hit 'enter'.

* More often, you may need to compare two arrays lexicographically. The method compare(arr1, arr2) of Arrays class will
  be in hand in such cases. You may need to sort your arrays first.

* Collections.reverse(), as it is named, is the array reversing method.

* Avoid, as much as possible, the use of complicated classes in java to not face TLE judge message.

* Be careful when taking input from the command line.
